# Portfolio (Next.js + React)

This project was converted from a static HTML/CSS/JS site to a Next.js + React app in-place.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies
2. Start the dev server

## Notes

- Global styles are in `styles/` and imported in `pages/_app.js`.
- Static assets are served from `public/assets` and referenced as `/assets/...`.
- Interactivity (menu toggle, scroll reveal, footer year) is handled via React hooks in `pages/index.js`.
